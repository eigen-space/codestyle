# Scripts

## markdown-lint

### Why do we need that script?

We have a rule that we should understand why we put this dependency in project.  
So we describe every dependency in readme file of the project.  
To make sure we describe all dependencies we need a dependency linter.

### Documentation

Read more in JSDoc [here](./markdown-lint.js)

### When we run that script?

We run it locally and on CI with linter.
